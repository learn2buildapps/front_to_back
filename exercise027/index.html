  <h1>Text Indent</h1>
  <p>Indenting paragraphs is a common practice in writing to improve readability and make the text more visually
    appealing.
    It helps to distinguish the beginning of a new paragraph and creates a natural separation between them. Indenting
    also
    creates a visual cue that the reader is moving on to a new thought or idea. Additionally, it can help to organize
    the
    content and improve the overall structure of the text. Indenting is particularly important in longer pieces of
    writing,
    such as essays or articles, as it can help the reader to follow the flow of the text and understand the structure of
    the
    argument.</p>
