  <h1>Default Word Spacing</h1>
  <p>Word spacing refers to the amount of space between words
    in a written document, and it plays an important role in
    readability and visual appeal. Too little space between
    words can make text feel cramped and difficult to read,
    while too much space can create awkward gaps and disrupt
    the flow of the text. Generally, word spacing should be
    consistent and proportional, with enough space to clearly
    distinguish between individual words while maintaining a
    smooth and even texture.
