  <h1>Float Property</h1>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/small-game.jpg" alt="Small Game Image">
    <p>In CSS, the float property is used to position an element to the left or right of its container. When an element
      is
      floated, it is taken out of the normal document flow, which means other elements on the page can wrap around it.
      This
      can be useful for creating layouts with columns or for positioning images within a block of text. When an element
      is
      floated, its width is automatically set to "auto" unless otherwise specified, and its height is determined by the
      content it contains.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src="./images/small-game.jpg" alt="Small Game Image" class="float-right">
    <p>Floating an image to the right in CSS is a common technique used to position an image on the right side of a
      block of
      text or other content. This can help to break up large blocks of text and add visual interest to a web page or
      document.
      To float an image to the right, you can use the CSS float property with a value of "right". This will cause the
      image to
      be positioned to the right of any preceding content and aligned with the top of the content. If the content
      following
      the image is long enough, it will wrap around the image and flow to the left of it. It's important to use the
      appropriate CSS clearing techniques to ensure that the content after the floated image is positioned correctly and
      not
      affected by the float.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/small-game.jpg" alt="Small Game Image" class="float-left">
    <p>When an image is floated to the left, it is aligned to the left margin of the containing element and the text or
      content
      that follows it will wrap around the image on its right side. This allows for text to flow seamlessly around an
      image,
      creating a more visually appealing layout. Floating an image to the left can be useful for adding visual interest
      to a
      page, breaking up large blocks of text, and creating a more balanced layout. However, it's important to ensure
      that the
      text doesn't become too cramped around the image and that the image doesn't overwhelm the surrounding content.
      Proper
      use of margins, padding, and the clear property can help prevent these issues.</p>

    <p class="clear">It's important to note that floated elements must have a specified width in order to be positioned
      correctly. Also, if
      all of the elements within a container are floated, the container's height will collapse to zero, which can cause
      layout
      issues. To avoid this, you can use a clearfix to clear the floats and restore the container's height.</p>
