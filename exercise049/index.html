        span has an abosolute position within a paragraph that does not have a relative position so it will be adjusted

  <div>
    <p class="relative-position-top">This paragraph has a relative position shifted 10px down from the top. This is
      extra text to make the paragraph a bit longer so that we can see the absolute position of the span cover the top
      portion of this part. Add more text or shrink your browser window a bit to get the same effect.<span
