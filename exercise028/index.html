  <h1>Default Line Height</h1>
  <p>Line height refers to the amount of vertical space between each line of text in a written document. It is an
    important
    aspect of document design because it can greatly affect the readability and visual appeal of the text. A line height
    that is too small can make the text look cramped and difficult to read, while a line height that is too large can
    cause
    the lines to appear disconnected and disjointed. The appropriate line height for a document depends on several
    factors,
    including the font size, the typeface, and the overall layout of the document. Generally, a line height that is
    between
    120% and 150% of the font size is considered appropriate for most documents. This allows enough space for the text
    to
    breathe while still maintaining a comfortable and readable layout.</p>
