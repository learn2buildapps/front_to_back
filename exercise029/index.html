  <h1>Default Letter Spacing</h1>
  <p>Appropriate letter spacing is an important aspect of typography that can significantly affect the readability and
    legibility of written documents. Letter spacing, also known as tracking, refers to the space between individual
    letters
    in a word or line of text. When letter spacing is too tight, the letters can appear cramped and difficult to
    distinguish
    from one another, which can make reading more challenging. On the other hand, if the letter spacing is too wide, the
    letters can appear disjointed and difficult to group into words, which can also negatively impact readability. The
    goal
    of appropriate letter spacing is to strike a balance that ensures the text is easy to read and visually appealing.
